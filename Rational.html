   <h3>Rational:</h3>
    <p>Many questions should be explored through this research; one of them is how academic tasks affect students’ sleep and vice versa?</p>
    <p>As mentioned before, many researches are done concerning sleep deprivation. Therefore, many ideas and hypotheses were generated concerning this broad topic because not only members of the medical field have worked on that topic but also members from the broad science community that aren’t necessarily involved in the medical field. One of these famous hypotheses – I called it the roundabout hypothesis – because in my opinion, each item of it causes the other one and vice versa. And also, if studied well through research methods, it’ll be able to prove a definite causation. This hypothesis refers to that academic tasks cause depression and stress causing by that sleep deprivation, and roundly sleep deprivation causes stress and depression leading to the student’s academic failure or academic decadence.</p>
    <p>If this hypothesis is confirmed, it’ll for sure give a definite answer to this topic and it will for sure push the academic employers to decreases the number of academic tasks just enough to decrease depression, stress and sleep deprivation but in the same time to keep the academic improvement. In other words, increase quality and decrease quantity. If it’s not confirmed, I’ll give the insight to other ideas -- through that research -- or even other hypothesis derived from that same hypothesis.</p>
