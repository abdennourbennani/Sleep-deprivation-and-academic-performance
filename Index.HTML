    <h1>Sleep deprivation and academic performance</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many researches were done concerning sleep deprivation effects, in general, and specifically how does it affect a specific generation of people. This topic would be really important and classified as it belongs to many fields such as biology, psychology, sociology…etc.  This research’s results should be taught in the beginning of every course in high schools and colleges because first it’s important to know about it and second because these generations from high schools and colleges are the most people affected by this problem. </p>
    <h3>Background/ Review of literature:</h3>
    <P>From what known concerning this sleep matter, deprivation in sleep really affect the human body in general causing it to not function as good as it should – that’s for people in general, and specifically for the students. It’s known that sleep deprivation decreases the neurons’ functions. Thus, it decreases all the body function including thinking which is important for a student especially for their academic field. </p>
    <p>Many critical conversations were done concerning the topic of sleep deprivation in general. One of them said that a perfect quantity of sleep leads student to get a very effective learning by increasing memory and other brain functions. In contrast, not getting enough sleep leads to a huge decrease in the academical, personal and social life – for students particularly -- because it decreases attention and other brain and body functions while their brains are still being developed. This statement is scientifically and socially accepted because this type of information was concluded from many studies that were done over and over using various experimental methodologies.</p>
    <p>Another critical conversation was that earlier bedtimes that are correlated with long-enough amount of sleep cause great academic performance. This one was through a study involved 48 students between 16 and 19-years-old from a college. It would’ve been good if this study was done using a larger sample of students, and not depend only on correlation to conclude causation. But it still has a good information that can be further studied in different researches using a larger number of students and larger amount of time. If we combined this study with the first idea listed in the previous paragraph; they will be complementary and supportive to each other’s.</p>
    <p>From the same source and at the same time, it said that because of school commitments, students are obligated to wake up early despite the fact that they didn’t get enough sleep that they need for their brains and bodies to function in an optimal way. This study was able to explain one of the causes of sleep deprivation for students and also support one of the famous hypotheses that will be cited after.</p>
    <p>All these previously done studies are pouring their information in the same perforated glass. In other words, these studies are studying sleep deprivation of students and how it affects their academic performance but they didn’t include all the causes of sleep deprivation that causes decreasing of the academic performance and also, they didn’t include all the causes academic failure. Another way to look at it is through the following questions: Are school assignments or commitments in general are the main causes of sleep deprivation or is it the stress coming from these academic commitments?  is it the sleep deprivation what prevent academic failure?</p>
    <h3>Rational:</h3>
    <p>Many questions should be explored through this research; one of them is how academic tasks affect students’ sleep and vice versa?</p>
    <p>As mentioned before, many researches are done concerning sleep deprivation. Therefore, many ideas and hypotheses were generated concerning this broad topic because not only members of the medical field have worked on that topic but also members from the broad science community that aren’t necessarily involved in the medical field. One of these famous hypotheses – I called it the roundabout hypothesis – because in my opinion, each item of it causes the other one and vice versa. And also, if studied well through research methods, it’ll be able to prove a definite causation. This hypothesis refers to that academic tasks cause depression and stress causing by that sleep deprivation, and roundly sleep deprivation causes stress and depression leading to the student’s academic failure or academic decadence.</p>
    <p>If this hypothesis is confirmed, it’ll for sure give a definite answer to this topic and it will for sure push the academic employers to decreases the number of academic tasks just enough to decrease depression, stress and sleep deprivation but in the same time to keep the academic improvement. In other words, increase quality and decrease quantity. If it’s not confirmed, I’ll give the insight to other ideas -- through that research -- or even other hypothesis derived from that same hypothesis.</p>
    <h3>Methods and design:</h3>
    <p>For this research topic, it’ll be really beneficial to use multi-methodologies in order to address it from different angles and get accurate data. More specifically, this research will involve the following methods: interviewing students aged between 16 and 22 years old because they’re the most affected generations concerning this problem. Also, this research will depend on surveys as a method to get more information privately, quickly and efficiently. Observation method will also be present because while the students are being interviewed, they’re going to be observed how are they behaving? How are they answering questions (slowly or quickly), taking into consideration that they didn’t have enough sleep in the past period of time? Are they focusing while being interviewed? etc.… Another method that will be very beneficial in the case study method. It’s true that it’ll take time to study each case, to study how the sleep deprivation and academic improvement are related – for each student – throughout the years and how the personal circumstances are affecting both of them.</p>
    <p>Let’s start up with the interviewing process. This method will be very beneficial because it gives the participants the freedom of speak which would trigger them to reveal more personal and accurate data related to the topic that will of course be used after asking for their consent. Students will be hired to conduct the first interviews with student-participants in order to make them feel more comfortable because of the fact that their peers interviewing them and thereby answer questions as accurate as possible. Then we will hire professional interviewers to conduct the following interviews to get the possibility of comparing results. The interviews will be short and repeated between 3 and 4 times a term using different sets of questions. The participants will be high school and college students with an age range of 16-22 years with different backgrounds and different socio-economical stages (are their socio-economic status affecting their sleep and academical improvement in a certain way); these factors are being considered in order to get as much diversity as possible, get much broader view and thus get a general conclusion. Participants will be asked how much hours of sleep are they getting? How are their circumstances affecting their sleep and academic improvement? Do they feel in need of sleep before exams? Do they feel that sleep deprivation is preventing them from improving academically? How are their grades when they get enough sleep and when they don’t? Do they think that having fewer academic tasks would be helpful for getting enough sleep and keeping their academic improvement at the same time?</p>
    <p>The other method that will work hand in hand with the interviews is using surveys. First, they allow participants to answer questions comfortably knowing that their answers won’t be shared to the public and their actual identities won’t be revealed. And second, this method’s results will allow us to compare results from both or the four methods (including observation) and get average accurate data. These surveys won’t be a one-time survey, instead students should participate at least 3 to 4 times per term. Of course, participants will get some kind of encouragement such as a symbolic amount of money. This survey method would sometimes have some drawbacks such as some participants won’t participates and some of them will not answer correctly and the questions won’t apply of them.</p>
    <p>Case-study as well is an efficient method for this research topic. This one as listed previously, will consume a lot of time to study each case. So, in order to save that time, we will ask participants to write a paper or record themselves talking about their cases related to that topic throughout the years starting from the high school period. They will be asked to write about their academic changesets – for example how did their academic commitments changed compared with the first year of high school until now? The drawback of this method in this case is that this is not the right way to do case studies but it still efficient in many ways such as getting just what needed from each single case in short period of time.</p>
    <p>These questions will clarify how would sleep deprivation affect the students’ academic improvement. This clarification will be derived from the students’ point of views because often students know what really affect their academic improvement but they can’t control it due to some factors such as commitments, tasks and stress.</p>
    <p>Finally, my role in this research is going to be a multirole. In other words, I’m going to be one of the student-interviewers, an observer and also a participant in the surveys and the interviews because I think that my personal data as a college student with sleep deprivation problem would be beneficial this research.</p>
