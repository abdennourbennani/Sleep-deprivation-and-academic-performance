<h3>Methods and design:</h3>
    <p>For this research topic, it’ll be really beneficial to use multi-methodologies in order to address it from different angles and get accurate data. More specifically, this research will involve the following methods: interviewing students aged between 16 and 22 years old because they’re the most affected generations concerning this problem. Also, this research will depend on surveys as a method to get more information privately, quickly and efficiently. Observation method will also be present because while the students are being interviewed, they’re going to be observed how are they behaving? How are they answering questions (slowly or quickly), taking into consideration that they didn’t have enough sleep in the past period of time? Are they focusing while being interviewed? etc.… Another method that will be very beneficial in the case study method. It’s true that it’ll take time to study each case, to study how the sleep deprivation and academic improvement are related – for each student – throughout the years and how the personal circumstances are affecting both of them.</p>
    <p>Let’s start up with the interviewing process. This method will be very beneficial because it gives the participants the freedom of speak which would trigger them to reveal more personal and accurate data related to the topic that will of course be used after asking for their consent. Students will be hired to conduct the first interviews with student-participants in order to make them feel more comfortable because of the fact that their peers interviewing them and thereby answer questions as accurate as possible. Then we will hire professional interviewers to conduct the following interviews to get the possibility of comparing results. The interviews will be short and repeated between 3 and 4 times a term using different sets of questions. The participants will be high school and college students with an age range of 16-22 years with different backgrounds and different socio-economical stages (are their socio-economic status affecting their sleep and academical improvement in a certain way); these factors are being considered in order to get as much diversity as possible, get much broader view and thus get a general conclusion. Participants will be asked how much hours of sleep are they getting? How are their circumstances affecting their sleep and academic improvement? Do they feel in need of sleep before exams? Do they feel that sleep deprivation is preventing them from improving academically? How are their grades when they get enough sleep and when they don’t? Do they think that having fewer academic tasks would be helpful for getting enough sleep and keeping their academic improvement at the same time?</p>
    <p>The other method that will work hand in hand with the interviews is using surveys. First, they allow participants to answer questions comfortably knowing that their answers won’t be shared to the public and their actual identities won’t be revealed. And second, this method’s results will allow us to compare results from both or the four methods (including observation) and get average accurate data. These surveys won’t be a one-time survey, instead students should participate at least 3 to 4 times per term. Of course, participants will get some kind of encouragement such as a symbolic amount of money. This survey method would sometimes have some drawbacks such as some participants won’t participates and some of them will not answer correctly and the questions won’t apply of them.</p>
    <p>Case-study as well is an efficient method for this research topic. This one as listed previously, will consume a lot of time to study each case. So, in order to save that time, we will ask participants to write a paper or record themselves talking about their cases related to that topic throughout the years starting from the high school period. They will be asked to write about their academic changesets – for example how did their academic commitments changed compared with the first year of high school until now? The drawback of this method in this case is that this is not the right way to do case studies but it still efficient in many ways such as getting just what needed from each single case in short period of time.</p>
    <p>These questions will clarify how would sleep deprivation affect the students’ academic improvement. This clarification will be derived from the students’ point of views because often students know what really affect their academic improvement but they can’t control it due to some factors such as commitments, tasks and stress.</p>
    <p>Finally, my role in this research is going to be a multirole. In other words, I’m going to be one of the student-interviewers, an observer and also a participant in the surveys and the interviews because I think that my personal data as a college student with sleep deprivation problem would be beneficial this research.</p>
