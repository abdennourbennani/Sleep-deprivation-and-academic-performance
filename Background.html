    <h2>Background/ Review of literature:</h2>
    <P>From what known concerning this sleep matter, deprivation in sleep really affect the human body in general causing it to not function as good as it should – that’s for people in general, and specifically for the students. It’s known that sleep deprivation decreases the neurons’ functions. Thus, it decreases all the body function including thinking which is important for a student especially for their academic field. </p>
    <p>Many critical conversations were done concerning the topic of sleep deprivation in general. One of them said that a perfect quantity of sleep leads student to get a very effective learning by increasing memory and other brain functions. In contrast, not getting enough sleep leads to a huge decrease in the academical, personal and social life – for students particularly -- because it decreases attention and other brain and body functions while their brains are still being developed. This statement is scientifically and socially accepted because this type of information was concluded from many studies that were done over and over using various experimental methodologies.</p>
    <p>Another critical conversation was that earlier bedtimes that are correlated with long-enough amount of sleep cause great academic performance. This one was through a study involved 48 students between 16 and 19-years-old from a college. It would’ve been good if this study was done using a larger sample of students, and not depend only on correlation to conclude causation. But it still has a good information that can be further studied in different researches using a larger number of students and larger amount of time. If we combined this study with the first idea listed in the previous paragraph; they will be complementary and supportive to each other’s.</p>
    <p>From the same source and at the same time, it said that because of school commitments, students are obligated to wake up early despite the fact that they didn’t get enough sleep that they need for their brains and bodies to function in an optimal way. This study was able to explain one of the causes of sleep deprivation for students and also support one of the famous hypotheses that will be cited after.</p>
    <p>All these previously done studies are pouring their information in the same perforated glass. In other words, these studies are studying sleep deprivation of students and how it affects their academic performance but they didn’t include all the causes of sleep deprivation that causes decreasing of the academic performance and also, they didn’t include all the causes academic failure. Another way to look at it is through the following questions: Are school assignments or commitments in general are the main causes of sleep deprivation or is it the stress coming from these academic commitments?  is it the sleep deprivation what prevent academic failure?</p>
